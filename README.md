Hey there! I'm <b>Ashwin Vinod</b>, currently a college student at <a href="https://rit.ac.in">RIT Kottayam</a> pursuing
<i>Electronics and Communication Engineering</i>. I'm mostly interested in building highly integrated systems be it 
software or hardware.

I've worked on projects involving <b>computer vision, text analysis, containers, embedded systems based on arduino, esp32 </b>
and much more. My tendency to build side projects gave me quite a lot of exposure to a lot of technologies. My current 
pursuit is towards the hardware end, learning and experimenting in different sub-fields.

I've documented more in my website <a href="https://ashwinvin.github.com">ashwinvin.github.com </a>, check it out. Cheers!
